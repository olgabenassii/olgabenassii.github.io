<p style="text-align:center;"> <i> This second page will be dedicated to delve into the details of the Metodology </i></p>
<br>
<br>
The first thing we did was define a specific area of knowledge we were particularly interested in; <p style="color:red;">in this case, we opted for Archaeological sites. </p> <br>
We wanted to quantify how many archaeological sites were present in the ArCo ontology and assess if there was any left out of the knowledge graphs. <br>
In order to do so, we started with some queries:
<br>
<br>




Furthermore, thanks to our queries, we observed some missing conncections between the following elements: 
<ul>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Selinunte-Akropolis-bjs-2.jpg" alt="to get more information" style=width="250" height="250" img border= 5px solid #555; </a> 
  <br>
  <br>
We found that, in this case, this <i>insediamento</i> is placed in the <i>Parco Archeologico delle Terme di Baia</i>:
  <br>
  <br>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Selinunte-Akropolis-bjs-2.jpg" alt="to get more information" style=width="250" height="250" img border= 5px solid #555; </a>
Nevertheless, when looking for the connection between these two elements (example of query?), we found none.
</ul>
Therefore, what we would like to propose in this case is to link them thanks to the predicate "a-loc:isCulturalInstituteOrSiteOf"
