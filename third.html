<h1 style="text-align:center;"><b>Hello Again!</b> </h1>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <i> This second page will be dedicated to delve into the details of the Metodology </i></p>
<br>
<br>
The first thing we did was define a specific area of knowledge we were particularly interested in; <p style="color:red;">in this case, we opted for Archaeological sites. </p> <br>
We wanted to quantify how many archaeological sites were present in the ArCo ontology and assess if there was any left out of the knowledge graphs. <br>
In order to do so, we started with some queries:
<br>
<br>
Furthermore, thanks to our queries, we observed some missing conncections between the following elements: 

<img src="Insediamento terme di Baia.png" style=width="250" height="250" ;
<br>

We found that, in this case, this <i>insediamento</i> is placed in the <i>Parco Archeologico delle Terme di Baia</i>:
<br>

<img src="Parco Archeologico Terme di Baia.png" style=width="250" height="250" ; 
<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, when looking for the connection between these two elements (example of query?), we found none.

<br>
Therefore, what we would like to propose in this case is to link them thanks to the predicate "a-loc:isCulturalInstituteOrSiteOf" in the triple .
<br>
<a href="http://dati.beniculturali.it/mibact/luoghi/resource/CulturalInstituteOrSite/20169">Parco archeologico dei Campi Flegrei - Parco archeologico delle Terme di Baia</a> <br>

a-loc:isCulturalInstituteOrSiteOf <br>
<a href="https://w3id.org/arco/resource/ArchaeologicalProperty/1500919868 ">insediamento sparso, Parco archeologico delle terme di Baia (Età romana)</a>
<br>
<br>
Consulting LLMs such as ChatGPT, we also found out that the page of the <i>insediamento</i> could be improved: for example, ChatGPT proposed us to also add the materials used in the construction of the settlement, that is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pozzolana#:~:text=The%20designation%20pozzolana%20is%20derived,is%20used%20as%20a%20pozzolan"><i>pozzolana</i></a> <br> 
<br>
Taking advantage of this, we would like to introduce another new triple, with the predicate <b>"Arco-dd:hasMaterial" </b>.<br>
  
<a href="https://w3id.org/arco/resource/ArchaeologicalProperty/1500919868">insediamento sparso, Parco archeologico delle terme di Baia (Età romana)</a> <br>
arco-dd:hasMaterial <br>
<a href="https://dati.beniculturali.it/lodview-arco/resource/TechnicalCharacteristic/pozzolana.html">pozzolana</a> <br>
